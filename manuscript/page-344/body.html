I had read, also, somewhere in the Methodist Discipline, the following question and answer:</p><p>“<em>Question</em>. What shall be done for the extirpation of slavery?</p><p>“<em>Answer</em>. We declare that we are much as ever convinced of the great evil of slavery; therefore, no slaveholder shall be eligible to any official station in our church.”</p><p>These words sounded in my ears for a long time, and  encouraged me to hope. But, as I have before said, I was doomed to disappointment. Master Thomas seemed to be aware of my hopes and expectations concerning him. I have thought, before now, that he looked at me in answer to my glances, as much as to say, “I will teach you, young man, that, though I have parted with my sins, I have not parted with my sense. I shall hold my slaves, and go to heaven too.”</p></div> </div>
