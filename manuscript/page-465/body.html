It is perfectly sound; and, if slavery be <em>right</em>, Sabbath schools for teaching slaves to read the bible are <em>wrong</em>, and ought to be put down. These Christian class leaders were, to this extent, consistent. They had settled the question, that slavery is <em>right</em>, and, by that standard, they determined that Sabbath schools are wrong. To be sure, they were Protestant, and held to the great Protestant right of every man to <em>“search the scriptures”</em> for himself; but, then, to all general rules, there are <em>exceptions</em>. How convenient! What crimes may not be committed under the doctrine of the last remark. But, my dear, class leading Methodist brethren, did not condescend to give me a reason for breaking up the Sabbath school at St. Michael’s; it was enough that they had determined upon its destruction. I am, however, digressing.</p></div> </div>
