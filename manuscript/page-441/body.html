<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">afford to drink whisky during Christmas.</p><p>The fiddling, dancing and <em>“jubilee beating</em>,” was going on in all directions. This latter performance is strictly southern. It supplies the place of a violin, or of other musical instruments, and is played so easily, that almost every farm has its “Juba” beater. The performer improvises as he beats, and sings his merry songs, so ordering the words as to have them fall pat with the movement of his hands. Among a mass of nonsense and wild frolic, once in a while a sharp hit is given to the meanness of slaveholders. Take the following, for an example:</p><blockquote class="  "><pre><code>      _We raise de wheat,
      Dey gib us de corn;
      We bake de bread,
      Dey gib us de cruss;
</blockquote></div> </div>
