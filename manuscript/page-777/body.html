<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">mark the slave system as a grand aggregation of human horrors.</p><p>Most who are present, will have observed that leading men in this  country have been putting forth their skill to secure quiet to the nation. A system of measures to promote this object was adopted a few months ago in congress. The result of those measures is known. Instead of quiet, they have produced alarm; instead of peace, they have brought us war; and so it must ever be.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">While this nation is guilty of the enslavement of three millions of innocent men and women, it is as idle to think of having a sound and lasting peace, as it is to think there is no God to take cognizance of the affairs of men. There can be no peace to the wicked while slavery continues in the land. It will be condemned; and while it is condemned there will be agitation. Nature must cease to be nature; men must become monsters;</p></div> </div>
